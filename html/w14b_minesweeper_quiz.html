                Started to learn JavaSript fundamentals through https://learnxinyminutes.com/javascript/. It's good to think about going through the basics and comparing them with Python. One thing that boggles my mind is how JavaScript if you don't declare a variable with var, let or const, it will be globally scoped. Where in Python the location where its declared determines its scope. The type coercions is also weird, like you can add strings and ints together without throwing any error, which can lead to unexpected behaviour. The equality operator is weird, as JavaSript has both == and ===. == is a comparison using type coercion like "5" == 5 is true. Where as === is more similar to Python's ==.
            </p>

                The arrays in JavaScript look to be similar to Python Lists. The objects in JavaScript are similar to Python dictionaries. However, the key is always a string. A JavaScript Map is more closer to a Python dictionary as they key doesn't have to be a string.

                I also got a bit sidetracked and looked at how to create chrome extensions. Its just a bunch of files on your desktop that you can load into chrome. I created a simple extension to popup a message when clicked.

                Next week I will continue and learn control flows. Might take me longer than 2/3 weeks that I initially thought.
