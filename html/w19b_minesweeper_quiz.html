                I was sick for the past two weeks and did not progress my JavaScript learning. It's a bit disappointing, but I think the right thing to do is to focus on recovery when you're sick. It just means that it can be pretty painful restarting the habit. This week I'm continuing to learn from https://javascript.info/intro, its been exactly 20 days since I last visited the site.

                I'm also starting to question whether it makes sense to try build robust websites with testing and what not. It does create lots of friction when creating stuff, and I wonder if I should just embrace being scrapy. For example, it took me 1 week to display images side by side in a grid. Then I proceeded to spend the next 7 weeks to learn how to test it. And now its not even fully tested because I don't really know how to do it well. I think I'm sort of insane.

                Had a continued quick read, starting looking into data types. I want to try to put together some sort of way to classify and compare languages. I'm currently looking at JavaScript vs Python.

                Will continue next week.
