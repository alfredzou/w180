            This project is an experiment in quantity over quality. Inspired by the story in Art & Fear, I want to put the idea to the test: does producing more lead to better results? The book tells the story of a ceramics class divided into two groups â€” one graded on quantity and the other on quality. Surprisingly, the quantity group ended up producing the highest quality work. By continuously iterating, they naturally improved, while the quality-focused group got stuck in theory. I'm also heavily inspired by Jennifer Dewalt, who built 180 websites in 180 days to teach herself web development from scratch.
