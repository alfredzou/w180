                This week I continued to on testing Javascript using JSDOM. I found it very difficult to understand how mocking works, and essentially I’m finding it way too difficult to proceed (and hence generally unfun). I think I’ve found myself getting dangerously close to the vibe coding category, where I’m just trying code from chatgpt where I don’t understand it. I think I need to step back and focus on working on my shaky foundations. Based on my application, I think I know some areas I should target.

                I’m thinking of starting to read through https://learnxinyminutes.com/javascript/ and  https://javascript.info/ . Specifically on the topics of Commonjs vs ESM, imports (modules), datatypes, loops, functions, const vs let (scoping), mocking, browser stuff. Maybe should take about 2/3 weeks I’m guessing?
