                For this week I wanted to create something simple. Essentially click an image, which would take you to another page. I was surprised how difficult it was. First, I couldn’t get any image to show up because my nginx configuration file wasn’t pointed towards my images folder.

                Second, I spent way too long trying to use CSS to split up an image in half. This is to allow each image to act as a link to another page. I waste a lot of time trying to understand how to crop an image, but decided to instead use a SVG editor to break the image up into two. This was so much easier to work with, and is a good reminder to myself not to be stubborn and think flexibly.

                This website, was inspired by the choice Neo needs to make between taking the red or blue pill. If he takes the red pill, he wakes up to reality even if it's difficult. If he takes the blue pill, he remains in a comfortable illusion. This draws similar parallels to learning. You can either take the difficult path of deliberate practice, where you apply your learnings and learn from failure. Alternatively, you can stay in the comfortable bubble of learning through tutorials but never applying.

                From my past experience's, I've leaned heavily towards tutorials. However, recently I've been questioning this approach, and will focus more on application.
