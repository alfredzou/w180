                Week 15: JavaScript Learning

            <p>
                Continued to learn JavaSript fundamentals through https://learnxinyminutes.com/javascript/ and comparing with Python. The way JavaScript does its loops its weird. There is different syntax for interating through a counter compared to an interable like a list. Where in Python the syntax is consistent between both. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                JavaScript also handles its logical operators weirdly. In other languages they use 'and' and 'or' where as JavaScript uses && an ||. JavaScript also has a switch statement which acts as a simple case statement in SQL. Where as JavaScipts if statement is essentially a searched case statement, and similar to Python. Python has it's own switch statement called a match statement.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                JavaScript has legacy features like var, which is frustrating. Var is function scoped, where as let and const are blocked scope. Can't really see the benefit of block scoping at the moment.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Again I am confused about scoping. Don't really know the difference between JavaScript and Python scoping. For Python I got really confused with Scoping and Namespaces. For interest of not diving into a rabbit hole, I think I will ignore this and move on.
            </p>

                <li>Python for loops are more consistent than JavaScript</li>
                <li>JavaScript logical operators are weird</li>
                <li>Python has a switch statement, which is essentially the same as a simple case statement</li>
                <li>Var is function scoped and legacy, I wish there was a JavaSript2, similar to Python</li>
                <li>Let and const are block scoped. Don't really see the benefit of block scoping</li>
                <li>Scoping is confusing, and I don't really understand Python scoping and namespace.</li>
