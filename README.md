# 180 Websites in 180 Weeks

This project is an experiment in *quantity over quality*. Inspired by the story in *Art & Fear*, I want to put the idea to the test: does producing more lead to better results?

The book tells the story of a ceramics class divided into two groups â€” one graded on quantity and the other on quality. Surprisingly, the quantity group ended up producing the highest quality work. By continuously iterating, they naturally improved, while the quality-focused group got stuck in theory.

I'm also heavily inspired by [Jennifer Dewalt](https://jenniferdewalt.com/), who built *180 websites in 180 days* to teach herself web development from scratch.

# The Challenge

**180 Websites in 180 Weeks.**

1. Every week, I'll design, build and launch a new website for 180 consecutive weeks.
2. No revisiting old websites, keep moving forwards.
3. Every website must be accompanied by a blog post documenting challenges and key takeaways.
4. All code will be publically available on GitHub.

# Setup

The website is hosted at [w180.dev](https://w180.dev) using nginx running on an EC2 micro instance.
