# w180

Building 180 websites to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript.

This project is heavily inspired by Jennifer Dewalt's '180 Websites in 180 Days" challenge. She learnt to code by building one website every day for 180 days, with no prior web development experience. Her project can be found here: https://jenniferdewalt.com/
